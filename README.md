# Clinical Booking System

##  Project Overview

The **Clinical Booking System** is a robust, SQL-powered backend solution designed to manage patient appointments, doctor schedules, and clinical operations efficiently. This project serves as the foundation for a healthcare appointment management system that facilitates smooth interaction between patients, healthcare professionals, and administrative staff.

It aims to streamline clinical workflows by automating the scheduling, rescheduling, and cancellation of appointments while maintaining a secure, centralized database of patients, doctors, and bookings. This system is intended for small to medium-sized clinics looking to transition from manual processes to a digital, database-driven approach.

##  Core Features

###  Patient Management

* Stores detailed patient information: name, gender, date of birth, contact, medical notes, etc.
* Tracks historical appointment data for each patient.

###  Doctor Management

* Maintains records of doctorsâ€™ details, specialties, working hours, and availability.
* Supports dynamic schedule updates.

###  Appointment Booking

* Enables appointment creation between patients and doctors based on availability.
* Prevents double-booking through smart conflict checking in SQL.
* Allows rescheduling and cancellation of appointments with integrity maintained across records.

###  Time Slot Allocation

* Custom time slot durations per doctor (e.g., 15/30 minutes).
* Automatically calculates available slots using SQL logic.
* Accounts for doctor working hours and break times.

###  User Role Support (optional enhancement)

* Admins: Manage the entire system, including all users, doctors, and appointments.
* Receptionists: Schedule, cancel, and update appointments.
* Doctors: View their own schedules and patient history.

##  Technology Stack

* **SQL Dialect**: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server (Depending on deployment)
* **Schema Design**: Normalized relational database (3NF)
* **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulated logic for booking/rescheduling/cancellation
* **Views & Joins**: Used to present comprehensive data summaries for clinics
* **Triggers**: Handle audit trails, automatic timestamps, and data integrity
* **Indexing**: Optimized for fast lookups of patient/doctor/appointment data
* **Security**: Input validation, access control considerations for future integration

## Database Schema Overview

**Key Tables:**

* `patients (patient_id, name, dob, contact_info, medical_history)`
* `doctors (doctor_id, name, specialty, contact_info, available_hours)`
* `appointments (appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, appointment_time, status)`
* `schedules (doctor_id, weekday, start_time, end_time)`
* `cancellations (appointment_id, reason, cancelled_by, cancelled_at)`

All table relations follow primary/foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity.

##  Sample SQL Workflow

1. **Book Appointment**

   ```sql
   CALL book_appointment(p_patient_id, p_doctor_id, p_datetime);
   ```

2. **Cancel Appointment**

   ```sql
   CALL cancel_appointment(p_appointment_id, p_reason, p_user_id);
   ```

3. **Get Available Slots**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_available_slots(p_doctor_id, p_date);
   ```

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Integration with a web front-end or mobile app
* Role-based access with authentication and authorization
* SMS/email appointment reminders
* Patient portal for self-service booking
* Reporting and analytics dashboard (e.g., daily appointment counts, missed visits)

---

##  Deployment Notes

* Ensure the SQL scripts are executed in order (schema, seed data, procedures).
* Customize time zones and clinic hours based on your location.
* Scheduled backups and logs should be maintained externally.
